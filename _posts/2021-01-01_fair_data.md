The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a state-of-the-art research facility that generates intense neutron beams to probe the fundamental properties of matter. To harness the immense potential of these neutron beams, a robust data infrastructure is essential. I was proud to be part of the team that built **Scicat**, the backbone of this critical infrastructure.

As a key contributor to this project, I played a crucial role in:

* **Designing a robust data model** to efficiently store and retrieve vast amounts of scientific data.
* **Developing powerful APIs** to enable seamless integration with other systems and tools.
* **Creating a user-friendly interface** that empowers researchers to explore and analyze data with ease.
* **Ensuring data quality** through rigorous validation and cleaning procedures.
* **Collaborating closely with scientists** to tailor Scicat to their specific needs. 

By working together, we've created a powerful tool that will accelerate scientific discovery and drive innovation for years to come.
