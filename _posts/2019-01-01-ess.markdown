I played a key role in building **Scicat**, the backbone of the ESS data infrastructure. My contributions included:

* **Designing the data model:** Ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
* **Developing APIs:** Enabling seamless data access and integration.
* **Creating a user-friendly interface:** Empowering researchers to explore data effortlessly.
* **Guaranteeing data quality:** Implementing robust validation and cleaning procedures.
* **Collaborating with scientists:** Tailoring Scicat to their specific needs. 

By working closely with scientists, I helped create a powerful tool that unlocks the potential of ESS data.
