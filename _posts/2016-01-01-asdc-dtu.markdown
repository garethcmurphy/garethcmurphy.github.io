I was part of the team that built the **ASDC**, a cutting-edge platform that revolutionizes atmospheric and space science research. This platform serves as a central hub for archiving, managing, and distributing critical data from the ASIM instrument aboard the International Space Station. As part of this exciting project, I:
* **Automated data collection:** Developed pipelines to seamlessly ingest data from various sources.
* **Ensured data quality:** Implemented rigorous validation and quality control procedures.
* **Empowered researchers:** Designed a user-friendly interface for easy data discovery and access.
* **Secured the future of science:** Implemented strategies for long-term data preservation.
* **Collaborated with scientists:** Tailored the ASDC to meet their specific needs. 

By working closely with scientists, I contributed to the advancement of atmospheric and space science by providing researchers with easy access to high-quality data.
