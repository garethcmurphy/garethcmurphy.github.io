Ever wondered what happens when a massive star explodes? Buckle up, because I've been building a virtual universe to simulate just that â€“ supernovae and stellar jets! This isn't your average code. It's a **2nd order finite volume magnetohydrodynamics beast**, written to capture the mind-blowing physics behind these cosmic events. 

Think of it as a super-powered calculator, churning through equations to model the flow of charged particles, magnetic fields, and the sheer energy unleashed in a star's death throes.

**Here's the tech behind the explosion:**

* **64-Bit Brawn:** This code can handle massive datasets, essential for capturing the immense scale of supernovae. 
* **HDF5: Friend of Visualization Tools:** Need to see the results? No problem! This code uses HDF5, allowing you to plug the data into popular visualization tools like Matlab or IDL and create stunning animations.
* **MPI: Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:** Simulations this complex require a lot of processing power. MPI allows the code to run across multiple processors, speeding things up significantly. 
* **Second-Order Godunov Scheme:** This fancy name translates to a super accurate way of modeling the flow of matter and energy within the exploding star.
* **Choice of Riemann Solvers:** Different situations call for different tools. This code offers a toolbox of Riemann solvers (Roe, HLLD, Lax-Friedrichs) to tackle various scenarios.

**Ready to Dive Deep?**

The code is now available! .  Let's explore the universe together, one simulated supernova at a time.
