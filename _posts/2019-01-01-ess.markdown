Contributed to the development and implementation of the **Scicat** platform, a critical component of the ESS data infrastructure. Key responsibilities included, Data Model Design, API development: 

* **Data Model Design:** Participated in designing the data model to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis.
* **API Development:** Developed RESTful APIs to enable seamless data access and integration with other systems.
* **User Interface Development:** Designed and implemented a user-friendly web interface for researchers to search, browse, and download data.
* **Data Quality Assurance:** Implemented data validation and cleaning procedures to maintain data integrity.
* **Collaboration with Scientists:** Worked closely with scientists to understand their data needs and tailor Scicat to their requirements.

Through these efforts, I contributed to the creation of a powerful tool for researchers to access and utilize the vast amounts of data generated by the ESS facility.
