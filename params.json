I also work on collisionless shock waves.\r\n\r\n### Plasma jets\r\nJets of plasma underlie many of the most spectacular and energetic events in the Universe, such as radio quasars, supernova remnants, and gamma ray bursts. Understanding the physical processes driving the launching, exciting the variability, and maintaining the collimation of jets is the main focus of my research. Since we cannot reach astrophysical temperatures and densities in the laboratory, I use supercomputer simulations to probe the physics of jet launching systems, and uncover how angular momentum is transported. I am also interested in energetic collisionless shock waves in supernova remnants and gamma ray bursts.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
