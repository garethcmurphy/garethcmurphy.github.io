The **European Spallation Source (ESS)** is a state-of-the-art research facility 🔬 that generates intense neutron beams 🌟 to probe the fundamental properties of matter. To harness the immense potential of these neutron beams, a robust data infrastructure is essential 🛠️. I was proud to be part of the team that built **Scicat** 💾, the backbone of this critical infrastructure.

As a key contributor to this project, I played a crucial role in:

* **Designing a robust data model** 🗂️ to efficiently store and retrieve vast amounts of scientific data.
* **Developing powerful APIs** 🔌 to enable seamless integration with other systems and tools.
* **Creating a user-friendly interface** 🖥️ that empowers researchers to explore and analyze data with ease.
* **Ensuring data quality** ✔️ through rigorous validation and cleaning procedures.
* **Collaborating closely with scientists** 🤝 to tailor Scicat to their specific needs.
