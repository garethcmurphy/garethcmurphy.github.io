Contributed to the development and maintenance of the **ASDC (Atmospheric Science Data Centre)**, a platform for archiving, managing, and distributing atmospheric and space science data. Key responsibilities included: 

* **Data Ingestion:** Developed and implemented data ingestion pipelines to automatically collect and process data from various sources.
* **Data Quality Assurance:** Implemented data validation and quality control procedures to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
* **Data Discovery and Access:** Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for searching and downloading data.
* **Data Preservation:** Implemented strategies for long-term data preservation and archiving.
* **Collaboration with Scientists:** Worked closely with scientists to understand their data needs and tailor the ASDC to their requirements. 

Through these efforts, I contributed to the advancement of atmospheric and space science research by providing researchers with easy access to high-quality data.
