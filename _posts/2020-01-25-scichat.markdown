**Tired of muffled voice calls and noisy audio recordings?** We've been working on a solution that leverages the power of **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** to clean up your audio.
**The Challenge:**
Electronic noise is a common culprit that can degrade the quality of speech signals. Traditional software-based solutions can be computationally intensive and power-hungry. 
**Our Approach:**
We designed and implemented **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters** on an FPGA. These digital filters are like a magical sieve, separating the desired speech signal from unwanted noise.
