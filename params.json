I also work on collisionless shock waves.\r\n\r\n### Plasma jets\r\nJets of plasma underlie many of the most spectacular and energetic events in the Universe, such as radio quasars, supernova remnants, and gamma ray bursts. Understanding the physical processes driving the launching, exciting the variability, and maintaining the collimation of jets is the main focus of my research. Since we cannot reach astrophysical temperatures and densities in the laboratory, I use supercomputer simulations to probe the physics of jet launching systems, and uncover how angular momentum is transported. I am also interested in energetic collisionless shock waves in supernova remnants and gamma ray bursts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Magnetic Vortices in Shock Transition Layers\r\nThe prompt emissions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are attributed to radiating ultrarelativistic electrons. Kinetic energy dominated internal shocks propagating through a jet launched by a stellar implosion, are expected to dually amplify the magnetic field and accelerate electrons. The Weibel instability generates filaments, which can be deflected and rotated into magnetic vortices, similar to the cross-section of a spheromak. The vortex can provide a stable storage structure for magnetic field energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ejection from weakly magnetised disks\r\nCold steady-state disk wind theory from near Keplerian accretion disks requires a large scale magnetic field at near equipartition strength. However the minimum magnetization has never been tested with time dependent simulations. Astrophysical disks with superheated surface layers could drive analogous outflows even if their midplane magnetization is low. Sufficient angular momentum would be extracted by the turbulent viscosity to allow the accretion process to continue. The magnetized outflows would be no more than byproducts, rather than a fundamental driver of accretion. However, if the midplane magnetization increases towards the center, a natural transition to an inner jet dominated disk could be achieved.\r\n\r\n### Binary Jets\r\nBipolar jets created by the magnetized accretion process are an important signpost for star formation. While forming stars have a high binarity, this is not the case for bipolar jets and only a handful of binary jets have been observed. One reason for this binary jet desert may be an inherent instability in the jets caused by the orbital motion of the binary system. I performed the first simulations of interacting jets from binary stars. This led to the discovery that the interaction has strong effects on the flow, producing kinks in the beam identifiable in observations. I also examined the effects of the rotation of the binary source and conditions under which the jets could merge to produce a single jet.","google":"UA-72997234-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
